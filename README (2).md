PROJECT: DATA LAKE

# Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

# Project Description
To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

# Project Datasets
You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

# Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}


# Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

Schema for Song Play Analysis
The star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

# Fact Table
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
Dimension Tables
users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

# Project Template
The project template includes three files:
- etl.py reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3
- dl.cfg contains AWS credentials
- README.md provides discussion on process and decisions
    
    
# DOCUMENT PROCESS

A. The purpose of Sparkify database  and its analytical goals
Sparkify data in scattered logs and meta data will not provide this easy and rapid quries. A simple and better way to represent data in a structured way is to model the data to allow for easy read and analysis is to used a relational database (postgreSQL) since the company is a startup and has less or no big data. This database will also allow for queries on the data and very fast.

B. Justification for  database schema design and ETL pipeline
The many focus of the analytics at Sparkify is to analyse what songs users are listening to. A star schema design model will provide this need for the analytics team. It allows for rapid queries on tables.

C. Examples of queries and results for song play analysis.

# PROJECT STEPS
Below are steps you can follow to complete each component of this project.
CREATE TABLE SCHEMAS
The ETL pipeline loads the s3 data sources into spark dataframes into the schema and writes the data to s3.
BUILD ETL PIPELINE
- Create an AWS IAM role with s3 read and write access.
- Enter the IAM's. credentials in the dl.cfg file.
- Create an s3 bucket and enter the URL to the in etl.py as the value of output data.
- Run 'etl.py' to process the data and store it on your created s3 bucket.
- Delete your bucket cluster when finished.



# RUNNING PROJECT
- Install and configure Python, Jupyter and Set up your Amazon Website Service (AWS) account.
- Connect to AWS and create a  S3 bucket.
- Run 'etl.py' file
    Using  !python etl.py in the console
- Run queries on 'python etl.py'to get sample queries result for analysises
- Delete your redshift S3 bucket when finished.
